# Introduction to Machine Learning – Kaggle (6th Semester)

This repository contains my coursework and practice exercises completed as part of the Introduction to Machine Learning module in the 6th semester of my Computer Science degree. The work follows the Kaggle Intro to Machine Learning course and focuses on building, validating, and improving regression models using Python and Scikit-learn.

## Course Exercises

1. How Models Work  
2. Basic Data Exploration  
3. Your First Machine Learning Model  
4. Model Validation  
5. Underfitting and Overfitting  
6. Random Forests  
7. Machine Learning Competitions  
 
## Technologies Used

- Python  
- Pandas  
- NumPy  
- Scikit-learn  
- Jupyter Notebook / Kaggle Notebook  

## Dataset

The exercises use the Iowa House Prices dataset from Kaggle. The objective is to predict house sale prices based on structured features such as lot area, year built, floor size, number of rooms, and bathrooms.

## Learning Outcomes

Through this coursework, I gained practical experience in:

- Data exploration and preprocessing  
- Training regression models  
- Evaluating models using Mean Absolute Error (MAE)  
- Handling overfitting and underfitting  
- Applying ensemble methods such as Random Forest  

This repository serves as part of my sixth semester Machine Learning academic coursework and portfolio.
